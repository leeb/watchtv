# Watch TV

This is a TVHeadend GTK desktop client, created in Python.

## Overview

I wanted a quick and lightweight desktop app to watch a TV stream from a TVHeadend server. I couldn't find anything I liked, so I wrote one over a few evenings. It doesn't do much more than allow the user to watch a live broadcast and change channels. I may add more features in the future, but for now it's a simple app that does one job well enough to be useful.

## Future Options

An incomplete list of features as they occur to me.

Simple
* Select audio streams (I haven't needed this yet for UK DTV)
* Switch audio output device.

Less simple
* Program guide interface using schedules from TVH.
* Create and playback DVR recordings.
